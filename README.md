# AutomataWeaver

AutomataWeaver is an web simulator for Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), Pushdown Automata (PDA), and Turing Machines. The project is designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for simulating these machines, offering a user-friendly interface and a powerful backend API for automaton management.
## Project Overview

The goal of **AutomataWeaver** is to offer a robust tool for the study and simulation of different types of automata. The simulator is built with a strong emphasis on usability, and it allows users to:

- Create and manage automaton definitions.
- Simulate DFA, NFA, PDA, and Turing machine behaviors.
- Visualize transitions and automaton states.
- Create and manage user profiles for personalized experience.
## Features

- **Backend API** built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for managing automatons and user data.
- **Frontend UI** for interacting with the automaton simulator and visualizing states and transitions.
- **Authentication** with Passport.js for user login, signup, and password management.
- **Account management** features for updating profiles, resetting passwords, and deleting accounts.
- **Simulation logic** for DFA, NFA, PDA, and Turing machines, integrated into the frontend.
